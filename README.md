# Technologies Used
This project is written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

# Problems
I wanted to add a modal that would pop up after selecting an answer, either correct or incorrect with a corresponding photo and whitty comment. I was unsure of how to do so with different content for each question. Will return back to this project to make updates when I'm able to.

### Stretch Goals
